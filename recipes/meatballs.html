    <img src="../recipes/img/meatballs.jpg" width="300">

    <h3>These easy oven-baked Italian meatballs are incredibly tender and juicy with
        irresistible flavors that will have you craving for more. Made with ground beef,
        onion, garlic, parmesan cheese, and parsley, these meatballs are seasoned to
        perfection and ready to be served in just 30 minutes!</h3>

    <p>One of my favorite indulgences growing up was a plate of spaghetti
       and meatballs served at our small local Italian restaurant, which I still 
       reminisce about to this day.</p>

    <h4><em>INGREDIENTS</em></h4>

    <ul>
        <li><em>ground beef</em></li>
        <li><em>italian breadcrumbs</em></li>
        <li><em>milk</em></li>
        <li><em>egg</em></li>
        <li><em>parmesan cheese</em></li>
        <li><em>onion and garlic</em></li>
        <li><em>parsley</em></li>
        <li><em>salt and pepper</em></li>     
    </ul>

    <h4><em>STEPS</em></h4>

    <ol>
        <li><em>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a baking mat.</em></li>
        <li><em>In a large mixing bowl, add Italian bread crumbs and milk. Combine well and set aside while preparing the other ingredients, for at least 5 minutes.</em></li>
        <li><em>Add ground beef, onion, garlic, egg, salt, black pepper, parmesan cheese, and parsley into the soaked bread crumb mixture, and mix with your hands until just combined. Do not overmix.</em></li>
        <li><em>Portion onto the prepared baking sheet (using a cookie or ice cream scoop will make it easier). Wet your hands with water, and roll meatballs into 2" diameter balls.</em></li>
        <li><em>Bake for about 15-20 minutes, or until the meatballs have reached an internal temperature of 165˚F (74°C). Remove from oven and drain off any excess fat. <strong>Serve with your favorite sauce and enjoy!</strong></em></li> 
    </ol>
