    <h3>Everyone needs a great everyday Spaghetti Bolognese recipe, and this is mine!
        The Bolognese Sauce is rich, thick and has beautiful depth of flavour. 
        It’s perfect for a quick midweek meal though if you have the time to simmer this Meat Sauce for a couple of hours,
        you’ll take it from seriously delish to <em>OMG this is amazing!!</em></h3>

    <p>And here she is – my Spag Bol. Rich, thick, incredible flavour in the sauce even if you only have time for a quick
       20 minute simmer. Though if you can slow cook for a couple of hours, it really takes it to another level!</p>

    <h4><em>INGREDIENTS</em></h4>

    <ul>
        <li><em>2 tbsp olive oil</em></li>
        <li><em>400g/14oz beef mince</em></li>
        <li><em>1 onion, diced</em></li>
        <li><em>2 garlic cloves, chopped</em></li>
        <li><em>100g/3½oz carrot, grated</em></li>
        <li><em>2 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes</em></li>
        <li><em>400ml/14fl oz stock (made from stock cube. Ideally beef, but any will do)</em></li>
        <li><em>400g/14oz dried spaghetti</em></li>
        <li><em>salt and pepper</em></li>   
    </ul>

    <h4><em>STEPS</em></h4>

    <ol>
        <li><em>Heat a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and once hot add the beef mince and
            a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook the mince until well browned over a medium-high heat (be careful not to burn the mince.
            It just needs to be a dark brown colour). Once browned, transfer the mince to a bowl and set aside.</em></li>
        <li><em>Add another tablespoon of oil to the saucepan you browned the mince in and turn the heat to medium. 
            Add the onions and a pinch of salt and fry gently for 5-6 minutes, or until softened and translucent. 
            Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the grated carrot then pour the mince and any juices in the bowl back 
            into the saucepan.</em></li>
        <li><em>Add the tomatoes to the pan and stir well to mix. Pour in the stock, bring to a simmer and then reduce the temperature 
            to simmer gently for 45 minutes, or until the sauce is thick and rich. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary. </em></li>
        <li><em>When ready to cook the spaghetti, heat a large saucepan of water and add a pinch of salt. Cook according to the packet
            instructions. Once the spaghetti is cooked through, drain and add to the pan with the bolognese sauce. <strong>Mix well and serve!</strong></em></li>
